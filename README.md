# GeneticAlgorithm

This is just a toy program, which helped me to get my head around how GAs work.

Prerequisites: Python 2.7, Numpy, Scipy.

Run the program and it will print the best (i.e. closest to target) string from each generation, until it gets it perfect. There's not much code in there, do have a play.
